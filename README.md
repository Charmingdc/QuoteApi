   ```
   The response will be a JSON array of quotes.

2. **Response Format**:

   Example response:
   ```json

      "The best way to deal with anger is to not let it control you.",
      "Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.",
      "He who angers you conquers you.",
      "Donâ€™t let anger consume you.",
      "Anger is a temporary madness.",
      ],
      "courage": [
       "Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.",
      "Fear is a reaction. Courage is a decision.",
      "Courage is grace under pressure.",
      "The only courage that matters is the kind that gets you from one moment to the next.",
      "Courage is not the absence of fear, but the willingness to face it.",
      "It takes courage to grow up and become who you really are.",
